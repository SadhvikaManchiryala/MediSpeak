# MedSpeak

MedSpeak is a simple web project that helps pharmacists communicate medicine instructions using audio.
Instead of reading a prescription, patients can scan a QR code and listen to instructions in their own language.

## Why I Built MediSpeak?

While observing pharmacies, I noticed that many patients especially elderly people have difficulty reading prescriptions.
This project was created to reduce confusion and help patients take medicines correctly by using audio instructions.

## How It Works

### Pharmacists Side
1. Open the `admin.html` page.
2. Enter the medicine name.
3. Choose the time and food instructions.
4. Click **Generate QR Code**.
5. Print the QR code and attach it to the medicine.

### Patients Side
1. Scan the QR code provided by the pharmacist.
2. A webpage opens with the medicine details.
3. Click **Hear Instructions** to listen to the instructions in Telugu.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- QR Code JS Library

### Note
This project is a prototype built for learning purposes and it currently supports limited instructions and one language,but it can be extended further.

### Future Improvements
-Support for multiple languages
-Better UI for pharmacists
-Mobile and User friendly design
-Backend integration for storing prescriptions
